# xslt
A collection of XSLT templates and functions that can be used with AIXM data sets, in particular with the 'Donlon" AIP Data Set Specimen.

The initial objective is put share a series of XSLT scripts that can be used to extract CSV formatted data for specific subjects (such as a list of navaids, designated points, etc.) from an AIP Data Set provided in AIXM 5.1.1.
See www.github.com/aixm/donlon for sample data.
